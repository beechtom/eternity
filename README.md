# Eternity
A text-based puzzle game where you must discover what happened to the colony ship Eternity.


You are a crew member aboard Eternity, a colony ship that carries all that remains of the human
race. Shortly after departing your home star system, most of the passengers and crew entered
cryogenic sleep, leaving a small skeleton crew to watch over the ship. The navigation system has
been on autopilot for the past few years travelling across the galaxy in search of a new home,
and nothing has gone wrong - until now.
